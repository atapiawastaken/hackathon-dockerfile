Certainly! Here is a complete Dockerfile for the React project as described, along with appropriate comments to explain each part.

```Dockerfile
# Use an official Node.js runtime as a parent image
FROM node:18.20.0

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy the package.json and yarn.lock (or package-lock.json if you use npm) files first
# This is done to leverage Docker's cache. Only changes in these files will trigger `npm install`.
COPY package.json yarn.lock ./

# Install dependencies
RUN yarn install

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Expose the port that the application will run on
EXPOSE 3000

# Define environment variable for production
ENV NODE_ENV=production

# Build the React application
RUN yarn build

# Start the application using a command
# In most React projects, you typically serve the build using a static server
# like `serve` or similar.
RUN yarn global add serve
CMD ["serve", "-s", "build"]

# Note:
# If you have a custom start command or dev scripts in your package.json,
# you might need to adjust the CMD part accordingly.
# CMD ["yarn", "start"] # For example, to run in development mode
```

### Explanation:

1. **Base Image**:
   ```dockerfile
   FROM node:18.20.0
   ```
   - This line sets the base image to an official Node.js image version 18.20.0.

2. **Setting Working Directory**:
   ```dockerfile
   WORKDIR /usr/src/app
   ```
   - This sets the working directory inside the container to `/usr/src/app`. All following commands will be run from this directory.

3. **Copying Package Definitions**:
   ```dockerfile
   COPY package.json yarn.lock ./
   ```
   - Copies the `package.json` and `yarn.lock` files into the container. This is done early to leverage Docker's caching to avoid re-running `yarn install` every time code changes if `package.json` or `yarn.lock` hasn't changed.

4. **Installing Dependencies**:
   ```dockerfile
   RUN yarn install
   ```
   - Runs `yarn install` to install all the dependencies listed in `package.json`.

5. **Copying Application Code**:
   ```dockerfile
   COPY . .
   ```
   - Copies the rest of the application code into the container.

6. **Exposing Port**:
   ```dockerfile
   EXPOSE 3000
   ```
   - Opens port 3000, which is the default port for React applications.

7. **Environment Variable**:
   ```dockerfile
   ENV NODE_ENV=production
   ```
   - Sets the environment variable `NODE_ENV` to `production` to ensure the React application runs in production mode.

8. **Building the Application**:
   ```dockerfile
   RUN yarn build
   ```
   - Runs the build script defined in `package.json`.

9. **Serve the Application**:
   ```dockerfile
   RUN yarn global add serve
   CMD ["serve", "-s", "build"]
   ```
   - First, installs `serve` globally. Then, uses `serve` to start a static server serving the build directory. `serve -s build` tells `serve` to serve the `build` directory, which is the output of the `yarn build` command.

### Notes:
- If you're developing and want to run the application in development mode, you might replace the CMD part with:
  ```dockerfile
  CMD ["yarn", "start"]
  ```
- Adjust the Dockerfile based on the specifics of your React project's start/build scripts and dependencies.
