Lazy: just used chatgpt with nodejs. 
Use github api to fetch a repo.
Reads repo and prompt chatgpt4o to generate a Dockerfile. 


For this "small" hackathons, I don't need starter repos or frameworks. Chatgpt and calling openai is more than enough.
For teams deploying frontend/backend, push live, providing a vector database ... that make sense. 
Providing a vector database and filesystem for your models could be very strong to retain ppl. Once your data is there, you don't want to migrate. 
Cursor didn't help me/wasn't better than just chatgpt on the side and copy pasting. 


I found this tool for sharing docker compose on hackathons: https://hub.docker.com/extensions/livecycle/docker-extension
    - Use Livecycle to share docker-compose via URL
